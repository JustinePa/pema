You can find here the two Dockerfiles that are used to build the PEMA image. 

The Dockerfile shown here is the one to build the ```pema``` Docker image. 
It builds on the ```pemabase``` image and adds the actual PEMA code.


In the ```pemabase``` subdirectory, you may find the Dockerfile that builds the ```pemabase``` Docker image.
This is the software base of PEMA, setting all the dependencies, tools and databases needed.
