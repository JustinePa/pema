Here is an example of an `analysis_directory`, the input for PEMA implementation.

The only **mandatory** directories and files are the `mydata` directory along with the `.fastq.gz` files included there 
and the `parameters.tsv` file.

Please, remove the README.md file that you will find on the `mydata` directory. Raw data files must be included there **only**.

Everything else on this directory is **optional**, depending on the parameters set you will choose.
