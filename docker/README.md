We have built a Docker image called ***[pemabase](https://hub.docker.com/r/hariszaf/pemabase)*** with all the dependencies PEMA requires. 

Then, we built another Docker image called ***[pema](https://hub.docker.com/r/hariszaf/pema)*** based on the *pemabase*. 

You **do not need to build** any of these as they are publicly available. 

You may use it for any further development.
